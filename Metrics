Performance metrics are a part of every machine learning pipeline.
They tell you if you are making progress, and put a number on it.
All ML models, whether its linear regression, or a SOTA technique like BERT,
need a metric to judge Performance

Metrics are different from loss functions.
Loss functions show a measure of model performance.
They are used to train a machine learning model
(using some kind of optimization like Gradient Descent)
and they are usually differentiable in the models parameters.

Metrics are used to monitor and measure of a model(during training and testing)
and dont need to be differentiable.

However, if for some tasks the performance metric is differentiable, 
it can also be used as a loss function (perhaps with some regularizations added to it), such as MSE.

Mean Squared error(MSE) is perhaps the most popular metric used for regression problems.
It is essentialy finds the avarage of the squared difference between the target value and the value predicted by the regression model
